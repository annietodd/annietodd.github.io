  <h1>Hey, I am Annie Todd </h1>

<h2> I'm just a girl from the west trying to make it in the city </h2>

  <img src="images/headshotcuny.JPG" alt="trees">

  <p> From the mountains of Colorado to the streets of New York City, you can find me at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism</p>
  <p> In the future, catch me working on war zone and human rights reporting. People living in these areas need to be represented and
      I hope I can represent them in the way they deserve. </p>

  <p> Quick facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> I've lived in Colorado, Italy, Wyoming, London and now NYC</li>
        <li> Coffee is my best friend </li>
        <li> Playing rugby is a huge part of my life. #backsforever </li>
        <li> I have a lot of dreams and I'm on my way to making them reality </li>
      </ul>

<p> Got coffee, life, reporting ideas for me?
