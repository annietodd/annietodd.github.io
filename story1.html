    <!-- Start news copy -->
    <p>In the corner of Jamaica Bay sits an open green space home to turtles and birds. The smell of salt from the bay and sound of planes landing at JFK fill the area, but underneath the green grass and shrubs lies decades of trash from residents of the Rockaways.</p>
    <p>The Edgemere Landfill remains untouched almost 30 years after it closed. Rockaway residents are now looking to the future of what how the 173 acre area could serve the community.</p>
    <p>“I was just fascinated by the site,” said Sonya Gimon, 29, Fort Greene. “I just thought ‘wow, this is an amazing piece of land.’”</p>
    <p>Gimon started the Landfill Project, made possible by the Taconic Fellowship Grant at Pratt Institute, in fall 2018. She partnered with the Rockaway Waterfront Alliance to begin brainstorming on what the community needed from the area.</p>
    <p>“We had always been using the landfill for educational purposes,” said Daniel Borrero, the Youth Leadership Program Administrator of the RWA, 23, Ozone Park. “We thought this was another great way to image what this space could look like.”</p>

    <p>Throughout the year, the Landfill Project and RWA ran workshops and conducted interviews with community members and what they wanted from the landfill when it switches hands from the Department of Sanitation to the Parks Department. Edgemere Landfill does not just have to become a park but can provide necessary resources for the Rockaway community, Borrero explained.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Why another park? The Community needed something they would like and something they would use."
    </blockquote>

    <p>“The Landfill Project expands on the recreational focus. We can also have energy, education and we can grow food or whatever may be,” said Borrero.</p>
    <p>Up until a few years ago, the RWA used to walk right onto the landfill. Then one day a gate went up. Borrero said there was uncertainty if the group keep using the area for education. Now to get onto the landfill, they need a permit from DSNY.</p>
    <p>“In the past year, we’ve gone three or four times,” said Borrero. “We were very confused as to who to contact. It wasn’t terribly hard, you just had to talk to the right people [at DSNY].”</p>

    <p>RWA member, 17 year-old Aleksandra Nasiukiewicz, from Far Rockaway and a senior at Scholars’ Academy, helped interview community members on the landfill’s future. She said people thought about turning Edgemere into something sustainable such as putting solar panels on it for energy or turning parts of it into a farm.</p>
    <p>“Why another park?” Aleksandra asked. “The community needed something they would like and something they would use."</p>
    <p>Gimon recognizes the challenges the project now faces. DSNY told Gimon they were open to reviewing the report on what the community wants to see happen to Edgemere. DSNY and the Parks Department however do not have the power to take action once the report is published, Gimon said. </p>
    <p>Dina Montes DSNY Press Secretary wrote in an email that there are no development plans at the moment for the landfill. She did not respond when asked about what the future of the landfill and the project looks like.</p>
    <p>“I’m not certain about the next steps after the report,” Gimon said. “It’s not going to be such a straight forward process.” </p>
